## Personal Take Aways

<h3> Learnings </h3>
While still trying to wrap my head around Javascript, I can say with confidence that the code-along was incredibly useful.  Involved in my stretch goal was a simple addition in which players can now add their initials to the gameboard to track their score.  Including this feature in the game allowed me to "connect the dots" in terms of how all working parts connect with each other.

Coming out of this project I am starting to feel more comfortable with Javascript, but I know there is still a tonne more to learn.  I look forward to adding further features down the road which I know will help me develop a stronger understanding.
